# Pokémon Type Checker

A desktop app that lets users look up Pokémon by name and view their image and type information.

## Overview

Features a custom-designed interface that allows users to:

* Search for Pokémon by name (using PokéAPI, may not include all Pokémon).
* View its sprite and up to two types.

Built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, and powered by **Electron** for desktop use.
This was my first web project — where I learned API integration and front-end design fundamentals.

## Features

* Real-time Pokémon data via **PokéAPI**.
* Custom UI and error handling
* Packaged for desktop using Electron.
